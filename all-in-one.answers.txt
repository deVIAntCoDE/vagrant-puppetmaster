# These answers are always needed.

# Y or N — Whether to install. Answer files must set this to "Y".

# from the OS’s repositories. If this is set to N, the installation will fail
# if the installer detects missing dependencies.

q_puppetmaster_install=y

# Y or N — Whether or not the installation is an all-in-one installation,

# is also known as a monolithic install.

# Puppet Master Answers
# These answers are generally needed if you are installing the puppet master
# role.

# String — An identifying string for the puppet master. This ID must be unique

# used as the puppet master’s certname.

# y or n; MUST BE LOWERCASE — Whether to check for updates whenever the pe-httpd
# service restarts. To get the correct update info, the server will pass some
# basic, anonymous info to Puppet Labs’ servers. Specifically, it will transmit:
# the IP address of the client
# the type and version of the client’s OS
# the installed version of PE
# the number of nodes licensed and the number of nodes used
# If you wish to disable update checks (e.g. if your company policy forbids
# transmitting this information), you will need to set this to n. You can also
# disable checking after installation by editing the
# /etc/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install file.

# that you need to manually add this question to your answer to file before an
# installation or upgrade.

# characters.
q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_auth_password=strongpassword01

# String — A publicly accessible hostname where the console can be accessed if
